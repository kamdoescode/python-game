# python-game

## Welcome to Code Breaker!

This is a 2 player game with the objective of correctly guessing the opposing player's code before they guess yours!  The game's logic is loosely based on the popular board game *Mastermind* and uses aspects of *Wordle* as well.  Read the instructions when the game starts to understand how to play.
